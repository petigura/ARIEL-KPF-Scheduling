I would like to make a Python-based repository to help me schedule targets on the Keck telescope. 
The targets are stored in a google spreadsheet and they will be scheduled by submitting observing blocks (OBs)
to Keck observatory (see below).

Requirements:

- use conda environment called ariel-rv to manage the python environment

- Use the following packages
 - astropy (for coordinate transformation)
 - pandas (for data munging)
 - matplotlib (for visualization)

- git-track the project
- build and update a README.md file that explains the different software components

The targets are stored on this google spreadsheet

And are publically accessible via this link:

Currently, I don't want to go currently, 

As a first step, I would like to connect to this google sheet and display the following information

- target ra, dec
- target vmag
- target period, and radius

# Observing strategy

The long-term observing strategy is to get four RVs of each Ariel target within a month. 
This will be accomplished by using the 

# Observing Blocks

Observing blocks OBs are described on this website

https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/kpf/buildingOBs/

and the ob-template.json file is an example
