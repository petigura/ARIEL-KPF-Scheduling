I would like to make a Python-based repository to help me schedule targets on the Keck telescope. 
The targets are stored in a google spreadsheet and they will be scheduled by submitting observing blocks (OBs)
to Keck observatory. These are batch submitted as json files, with fields described below

Requirements:

- use conda to manage the python environment

- Use the following packages
 - astropy (for coordinate transformation)
 - pandas (for data munging)
 - matplotlib (for visualization)

- git-track the project
- build and update a README.md file that explains the different software components

The targets are stored on this google spreadsheet

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gAAznK9h4rC-JTsTA1V8eBtJKIj53AjrTiyIJVjrGuE/edit?gid=1500126039#gid=1500126039

As a first step, I would like to connect to this google sheet and display the following information

- target ra, dec
- target vmag
