I would like to make a Python-based repository to help me schedule targets on the Keck telescope. 
The targets are stored in a google spreadsheet and they will be scheduled by submitting observing blocks (OBs)
to Keck observatory (see below).

Requirements:

- use conda environment called ariel-rv to manage the python environment

- Use the following packages
 - astropy (for coordinate transformation)
 - pandas (for data munging)
 - matplotlib (for visualization)

- git-track the project
- build and update a README.md file that explains the different software components

The targets are stored on this google spreadsheet

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gAAznK9h4rC-JTsTA1V8eBtJKIj53AjrTiyIJVjrGuE/edit?gid=1500126039#gid=1500126039


And are publically accessible via this link:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gAAznK9h4rC-JTsTA1V8eBtJKIj53AjrTiyIJVjrGuE/edit?usp=sharing

Currently, I don't want to go currently, 

As a first step, I would like to connect to this google sheet and display the following information

- target ra, dec
- target vmag
- target period, and radius

This should be created as static not interactive plots

# Observing strategy

The long-term observing strategy is to get four RVs of each Ariel target within a month. 
This will be accomplished by using the time constraint capability of the observing blocks. 
We will bin the targets up by RA. As a first step, I would like to select targets
RA = 20-24 hr between 11/1-12/1.

# Observing Blocks

Observing blocks OBs are described on this website

https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/kpf/buildingOBs/

and the ob-template.json file is an example. This is a lightly annotated json file of a template observation, 
it should be used to create new obs. Even though the annotations make the template an improperly formated
json file, they should be retained because the describe what the columns do

# The OBs will be uploaded manually to the Keck computers into N427

# Plotting

I would like to plot the airmass of all targets at the middle of the observation window.

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from astropy.time import Time
from astroplan import FixedTarget, Observer
from astroplan.plots import plot_airmass

time = Time('2018-01-02 19:00')
target = FixedTarget.from_name('HD 189733')
keck = Observer.at_site('Keck')
plot_airmass(target, keck, time, brightness_shading=True, altitude_yaxis=True)
```
